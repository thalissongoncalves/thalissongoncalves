<h2>🔎 About me</h2>

<p>
   Hello, welcome to my profile!

I am a Full Stack Developer with over 3 years of dedication to studies and training in the technology field. I have worked professionally as a developer and started my journey with hands-on experiences in IT maintenance and support.

My passion for technology started in childhood, but it was during my time in the Brazilian Army that I first encountered programming. There, I used Python to create automation scripts that optimized internal processes in the department where I worked. This experience sparked my desire to dive deeper into software development.

After leaving the Army, I began my self-taught studies, seeking free courses and practical learning opportunities. In November 2022, I was accepted into Trybe, a programming school focused on full stack web development, where I graduated in February 2024 after an intensive program with a focus on hands-on experience, real projects, and soft skills.

In July 2023, I landed my first professional opportunity as a developer, and since then, I have been refining my skills in modern technologies, with a focus on:

🧠 Fundamentals and Programming Logic: Shell, Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), Unit Testing.<br/>
🎨 Front-End: React, Redux, Context API, Testing with RTL, Agile Methodologies, Responsive Styling.<br/>
🛠️ Back-End: Node.js, Express, Docker, MySQL, TypeORM/ORM, JWT/Auth, OOP and SOLID principles.<br/>
📊 Computer Science: Python, Data Structures, Algorithms.<br/>
💬 Soft Skills: Communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and autonomy.<br/>

Currently, I am looking for new professional challenges where I can apply my skills to innovative projects and contribute with solutions that have a real impact.

📫 Let’s talk? I am open to opportunities in Full Stack Development, Front-End, Back-End, or related fields.
